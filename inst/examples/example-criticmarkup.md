# Critic Markup Syntax

Don't go around saying {--to people that--} the world owes you a living. The 
world owes you nothing. It was here first. {~~One ~> *Only*  one~~} thing is 
impossible for God: To find {++any++} sense in any copyright law on the planet.
{==Truth is stranger than fiction==}{>>strange but true<<}, but it is because
Fiction is {>>**obliged**<<} to stick to possibilities; Truth isnâ€™t.

{++ Edits
work across lines ++}. 

{-- Edits take precedence over code cunks and other highlighting
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
--}

But edits are not highlighted inside code like `r print("{>> hello <<}")`
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
{== plot(pressure) ==}
